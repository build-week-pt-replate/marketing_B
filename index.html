                    <p>RePlate is made up of a strong web development team which does most of the connecting and networking,
                    volunteers who assist with food delivery, homeless shelters which give a warm place to eat together 
                    and a chance to meet those you directly help, and last but not least, our restaurants who
                    provide us with yummy, safe food that was to be thrown away.</p>

                    <p>Our main goal at RePlate is to prevent food waste and use any extra food we can find to make sure
                    less fortunate souls do not go to sleep hungry tonight. Our teams make sure that while we accomplish this 
                    goal, we do so in a safe, respectable manner.</p>

                    <p>Networking is key here. The most important thing is knowing <span>who</span> has food, <span>where</span> they are located, 
                    <span>when</span> we can get it. RePlate has reached out and worked together with several teams all over the US that set up 
                    individual homeless shelters with an abundance of food at each location. Communication, passion, love, and hard-work made our 
                    vision become a reality.</p>
